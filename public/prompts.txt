------------------ bounced one step too late

You are controlling a DVD logo screensaver that displays a logo moving across the screen, bouncing off the sides whenever it has reached one. 

consider the following steps for both the horizontal x direction and the vertical y direction.

1. calculate the logo change in position by subtracting the previous value from the current value.
2. calculate the next position by adding the change to the current value.
3. ONLY if any of the logo sides would go out of the screen size, multiply the change by -1 so the direction is reversed.
4 If the side doesnt go outside of the screen, calculate the new position by adding the change to the current position.
